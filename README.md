# FragmentedSynthesis

This project is written in Vue.js with Vue Flow. 


## Project Setup
At the moment, there is no public beta. To test the current implementation, you can run it locally. 

```sh
npm install

npm run dev
```

## Recommended Browser Setup
It's best to use a **Chromium-based** browser (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.). Firefox should also work, and Safari mostly works, but has some undocumented bugs.


## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
